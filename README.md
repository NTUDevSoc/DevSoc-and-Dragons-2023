In the city of Snottingham, Wizard is considered an official title for a specific type of magic user, a title which provides some unique benefits. It is the law of the land that any individual practising magic under the official title of Wizard must have a minimum qualification of a Wizarding Initiate Mediocre Permit (or WIMP). To become a WIMP, one must pass a Wizarding Expertise Test (WET) provided by the Wizarding Examination Independent Regulating Delegation (WEIRD). The goal of this exam is to ascertain whether or not the applicant is a Wizard who uses official wizarding spells and fulfils the standard expectation of what a Wizard is.

The protagonists of this story are not wizards, and have to waffle their way though aquiring WIMPs!
